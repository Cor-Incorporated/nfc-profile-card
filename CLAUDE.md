# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TapForge - A Next.js application that integrates physical NFC cards with digital profiles for modern networking. The app allows users to share profiles with a tap, manage contact information, and use OCR to digitize business cards.

**Tech Stack:**

- Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Authentication: Clerk (GitHub/Google OAuth)
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Cloud Functions, Storage)
- OCR: Google Gemini API
- Payments: Stripe
- Hosting: Vercel

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server at localhost:3000

# Build & Production
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server

# Code Quality
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run type-check   # TypeScript type checking
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
```

## Project Architecture

The project follows Next.js 14 App Router conventions with the following planned structure:

- **app/** - Next.js App Router pages and API routes
  - **(auth)/** - Authenticated routes (dashboard, edit, contacts)
  - **(public)/** - Public routes (profile pages, landing)
  - **api/** - API endpoints for Clerk webhooks, OCR, vCard generation
- **components/** - React components organized by feature
- **lib/** - Utilities for Firebase, Stripe, and general helpers
- **types/** - TypeScript type definitions
- **firebase/** - Firebase configuration and Cloud Functions

## Key Features & Implementation Notes

### Authentication Flow

- Uses Clerk for authentication with GitHub/Google OAuth
- Webhook integration syncs Clerk users with Firestore
- Protected routes use Clerk middleware

### Profile System

- Dynamic routing at `/p/[username]` for public profiles
- Support for up to 10 social/portfolio links with automatic service detection
- VCard download functionality for contact exchange
- One-time URL support for enhanced security

### NFC Integration

- Physical NFC cards link to digital profiles
- Card management in user dashboard
- Analytics tracking for card taps

### OCR Functionality

- Uses Google Gemini API 1.5 Flash for business card scanning
- Converts scanned data to VCard format
- Immediate data deletion after processing for privacy

### Database Schema (Firestore)

Main collections:

- **users** - User profiles, NFC cards, subscription info
- **contacts** (subcollection) - Scanned/saved contacts per user
- **analytics** (subcollection) - Usage analytics per user

## Environment Variables Required

The project requires configuration in `.env.local`:

- Clerk API keys and webhook secrets
- Firebase project configuration
- Google Gemini API key
- Stripe keys (for payment features)

## Development Workflow

1. The project is currently in initial setup phase
2. Follow the setup instructions in README.md for environment configuration
3. Firebase project ID should be: `nfc-profile-card`
4. Use mobile-first responsive design approach
5. Maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance

## Important Considerations

- **Security**: Implement HTTPS-only, rate limiting, and secure token handling
- **Performance**: Target <2s initial load, >90 Lighthouse score
- **Browser Support**: Latest 2 versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
- **Mobile Support**: iPhone 12+, Android 10+

## Recent Implementation Notes (Sep 2025)

### Editor UI Improvements

- **Issue Fixed**: Component addition buttons moved from external sidebar to inside the canvas area for better mobile UX
- **Implementation**: Created AddComponentPlaceholder component as CraftJS-compatible draggable component
- **Approach**: Used proven drag-and-drop pattern with `connectors.create()` instead of programmatic component addition
- **Mobile-First**: Removed sidebar dependencies to focus on mobile-first design

### VCard Format Compliance

- **Issue Fixed**: VCard format was not iPhone-compatible
- **Solution**: Updated to VERSION:3.0 specification with proper TEL;TYPE=CELL format for Japanese phone numbers
- **Implementation**: ProfileInfo component generates compliant VCard files with UTF-8 encoding

### Component Management

- **Deletion Buttons**: All editable components (Text, ImageUpload, LinkButton, ProfileInfo) have deletion functionality
- **Image Upload**: ProfileInfo component supports avatar upload with Firebase Storage integration
- **Scrollable Popups**: All editing popups use `max-h-96 overflow-y-auto` for mobile compatibility

### Architecture Patterns

- **CraftJS Integration**: Always use `connectors.create()` for drag-and-drop instead of programmatic node creation
- **Component Registration**: All CraftJS components must be registered in the resolver
- **Element Wrapping**: Components inside Frame must be wrapped with `<Element is={ComponentName} />` pattern

### Auto-save Implementation

- **Debounced Saving**: 2-second debounce on all editor changes
- **State Monitoring**: Watches background, socialLinks, and editor query changes
- **Status Display**: Visual indicators for saving, saved, and error states

## Patent Risk Information (Updated: Sep 21, 2025)

### üö® Features to AVOID (High Patent Infringement Risk)

1. **Dynamic NFC Cards** - Cloud-synced cards that update profile data dynamically (Lifes. Patent #7356776)
2. **Camera Roll Auto-Detection** - Background monitoring for business card images (Yusoner Patent #7393248)
3. **Email Signature Parsing** - Auto-extraction from forwarded emails (Yusoner Patent #5538512)
4. **Enterprise B2B Features** - Avoid direct competition with Sansan's enterprise market

### ‚úÖ Safe Implementation Guidelines

- **NFC**: Use static URL linking only - no dynamic data fetching
- **OCR**: Implement in-app camera scanning with explicit user action
- **Target Market**: Focus on individuals and small teams, not enterprise B2B
- **Innovation Areas**: Visual customization, AI-powered features, community/social functions

### üìù Before Implementing New Features

Always check the "ÁâπË®±„É™„Çπ„ÇØÂõûÈÅøÈñãÁô∫„Ç¨„Ç§„Éâ„É©„Ç§„É≥.md" document and consult with legal counsel when planning:

- NFC card management features
- Business card scanning/OCR
- Automated data collection
- Enterprise-level features
